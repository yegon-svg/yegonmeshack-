# yegonmeshack-

This repository contains the MMU Bike Rental Hub static website.

## GitHub Pages

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. The workflow publishes the repository root after every push to the `main` branch.

Expected Pages URL:

https://yegon-svg.github.io/yegonmeshack-/

If the workflow runs successfully the site will become available at the URL above within a minute or two.

Notes:
- `.nojekyll` is included so GitHub will serve files as-is (no Jekyll processing).
- To trigger a deployment, push to `main` or edit files in the repository.

If you'd like, I can also add a `site-map.html` page listing internal links or configure a custom domain—tell me which you'd prefer.
